Introduction:  What is a "Native CMS" runtime library?
------------------------------------------------------

Language processors in CMS such as the assembler, FORTRAN, and PL/I, have
traditionally been ports of the versions that run on OS or MVS.  These programs
use OS macros, and therefore OS SVCs, to access system services.  CMS supports
this by simulating a limited set of OS services.  Thus, for example, a call to
allocate memory (GETMAIN) is mapped to the native CMS service (DMSFRE).

So what is the problem?  Because many OS programs (given the batch heritage of
that operating system) do not free the memory they use, CMS automatically frees
all OS memory after each command is run.  Thus it is not possible for a program
that uses OS services to call another such program as a CMS command.  The
obvious example of such a situation is the REXX processor (BREXX or Regina
REXX).  As things stand, since the REXX processor is uses C, and the existing
C runtime library uses OS simulation, it cannot call another program (such as a
compiler) that also uses OS simulation.

GCCLIB is a "Native" CMS GCC runtime library.  It removes these restrictions,
and uses only CMS services to access operating system functions.  If your goal
is to write C programs that are portable across operating systems, then this
library is probably not what you want to use.  But if you want to write
programs just for CMS, then this library will give you the best access to CMS
system services.

In CMS it is possible to load programs into memory and have them reamin their
for the rest of your session.  These are called "resident" programs.  Starting
with VM/SP, IBM made it possible for users to create resident programs via the
NUCXLOAD command.  In VM/370 we have the RESLIB command which performs a
similar function.  Using the RESLIB command, the GCCLIB library can be loaded
into memory.  When a C program is then loaded, it is linked to the memory-
resident runtime through some small stub routines.  The difference in program
size is dramatic:  a simple hello world program is 60K bytes in size, when all
of the needed runtime code is linked in.  The same program is less than 800
bytes in size using the resident library.

This means it is now possible to write programs that execute in the 8K CMS
transient area, and can be called in CMS Subset mode from within EDIT or other
programs.  Type HELP RESLIB for more information.

In the VM/370 Sixpack version 1.3 the runtime library is automatically loaded
loaded into CMS resident memory at CMS initialization time by SYSPROF EXEC S.


Using GCCLIB
------------

Use the GCC command to compile and assemble a C program, specifying the CMS or
LIB GCCLIB option.  Type HELP GCC for information on it the GCC command.

To load or run the program using the non-resident GCCLIB runtime library, give
the command GLOBAL TXTLIB GCCLIB before using the standard CMS LOAD command
followed by the GENMOD or START command.

To load or run the program using the resident GCCLIB runtime library, give
the command GLOBAL TXTLIB GCCRES before using the standard CMS LOAD command
followed by the GENMOD or START command.


CMS-Specific Functions in GCCLIB
--------------------------------

Beyond the functions provided by the standard C runtime library , GCCLIB
implements the following CMS-specific functions:
   CMSargstring()        return the unedited argument string
   CMScardPunch()        write a line to the virtual card punch
   CMScardRead()         read a line from the virtual card reader
   CMSclock()            return the system clock time
   CMScommand()          issue a CMS command
   CMSconsoleRead()      read a line from the console or program stack
   CMSconsoleWait()      wait for console I/O to complete
   CMSconsoleWrite()     write a line to the console
   CMSdebug()            call a debug routine where a breakpoint can be set
   CMSfileClose()        close a CMS file
   CMSfileErase()        erase a CMS file
   CMSfileOpen()         open a CMS file
   CMSfilePoint()        set the read or write pointer to a record in a file
   CMSfileRead()         read one or more records from a CMS file
   CMSfileRename()       rename a CMS file
   CMSfileState()        determine if a file exists
   CMSfileWrite()        write one or more records to a CMS file
   CMSgetClock()         get the system clock time
   CMSmemoryAlloc()      allocate memory
   CMSmemoryFree()       release allocated memory
   CMSprintLine()        write a line to the virtual printer
   CMSstackLine()        stack a line on the CMS program stack
   CMSstackQuery()       determine the number of lines in the program stack

For more details on these, see the CMSSYS H file, located on GCCCMS 202.


Limitations
-----------

GCCLIB does not yet implement the complete C runtime library.  The following
routine is not yet implemented:
   snprintf()        stdio.h

This version of GCCLIB no longer (ab)uses the DOSTRANS nucleus field which
avoids any difficulties caused by earlier versions with DOS under CMS.

Since GCCLIB does not use OS simulation, it is not necessary (or possible) to
use the FILEDEF command to define a file via an OS DDNAME.  Instead, the
fopen() function has been extended:

   FILE * fopen(const char * filespec, const char * access)

   Open the specified file and return a stream associated with that file.
      filespec is a pointer to a string containing the specification of the
               file to be opened:
         "CONSOLE"   terminal console (read or write)
         "PRINTER"   printer (write only)
         "PUNCH"     card punch (write only)
         "READER"    card reader (read only)
         filename filetype filemode [F|V [recordLength]]
                     disk file (read or write), where:
                     filename is the up to 8 character name.
                     filetype is the up to 8 character type.
                     filemode is the up to 2 character disk mode letter and
                              optional number.
                     F|V      specifies the record format fixed or variable.
                              It is ignored when opening a file for reading.
                     reclen   specifies the record length.  It is required for
                              fixed-length files, and is taken as the maximum
                              record length for variable-length files.  It is
                              ignored when opening a file for reading
                     Each of the above items must be separated by one or more
                     blanks.

      access   specifies how the file will be accessed (i.e. for input, output,
               etc):
               "r"   Open a text file for reading
               "w"   Create a text file for writing
               "a"   Append to a text file
               "rb"  Open a binary file for reading
               "wb"  Create a binary file for writing
               "ab"  Append to a binary file

   Notes:
      1.  The maximum record length is 65535 bytes.
      2.  The maximum number of records in a file is 32768.
      3.  The maximum number of 800-byte blocks in a file is 16060.
      4.  When writing a text file, a newline character signals the end of the
          current record.
      5.  When reading a text file, a newline character is inserted at the end
          of each record.
      6.  When writing a fixed-length text file the buffer will be padded with
          blanks if needed.
      7.  When writing a fixed-length binary file the buffer will be padded
          with NULLs if needed.
      8.  Opening a file for writing causes the existing file of that name to
          be erased, if it exists.

GCCLIB does not support I/O redirection.  If you need that, use the standard
GCC library, PDPCLIB.  In GCCLIB, printf() always prints on the console, and
scanf() always reads from the console.


Finally
-------

This code has not been thoroughly tested.  Don't use it for anything important
like controlling a nuclear reactor.  I'm just a hobbyist!
