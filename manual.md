Args flag and value (0 or 1)                                                                   

# Memory

## Global Process Memory
Two functions to help C programs avoid having any non-const static or global
variables. For programs planning to be run from a shared segment the program they will be
running in read-only memory and the CMS linker does not allow global variables to be placed in
another segment.

IBM calls these programs (ones that don't write to their TEXT segment) reentrant programs.
I have coined this memory - Process Global Memory.

Note: that this area is freed automatically on normal program termination.

```
void* CMSPGAll(size_t size) - Allocate / Reallocate Process Global Memory Block
void* CMSGetPG(void) - Get the address of the Process Global Memory Block
```

/*************************************************************************************************
int CMScardRead(char * line, int * len)

Read a line from the virtual card reader.
   line   is a pointer to the buffer into which the line is read.  As it is possible to read
          printer output files, the buffer should be at least 133 bytes in size.  The incoming
          line is terminated with a null character, forming a C string.
   len    is a poitner to a variable that receives the number of characters read.

Returns:
    0     Success.

int CMScommand(char * cmdLine, int cmdFlag)

Invoke a CMS command or service.
   cmdLine   is the command line to be executed by CMS.
   cmdFlag   specifies how the command to be invoked:
             CMS_COMMAND   the command is invoked as if called from an EXEC.
             CMS_CONSOLE   the command is invoked as if typed at the console.
             CMS_FUNCTION  the command is invoked as a CMS function.

Returns:
   the return code from the invoked command.

Notes:
   1.  Both a standard and extended parameter list (plist) are passed to the command.
   2.  Be aware that the command invoked can potentially overlay your program in memory.

          character, unless a subsequent call is to continue writing on the same line.  The
          string must be terminated with a null character.  The maximum number of characters
          to be displayed is 130; if the string pointed to by 'line' is greater than this, it
          is truncated without warning.
   edit   is CMS_EDIT (1) if trailing blanks are to be removed and a newline character added
          to the end of the line; CMS_NOEDIT (0) if not.

/*************************************************************************************************
int CMSfileOpen(char * fileid, char * buffer, int bufferSize, char format, int numRecords,
                int recordNum, CMSFILE * file)

Open a file for reading or writing.
   fileid     is a pointer to the CMS fileid, an 18 character field.  The first 8 characters
              are the filename, the next 8 are the filetype, and the last 2 are the filemode.
              Filename, filetype, and filemode must be in uppercase.  None of these fields are
              terminated with a NULL character.
   buffer     is the address of the buffer from which records are read from or written to.
   bufferSize is the size of the buffer.
   format     is 'F' if you are writing a file of fixed-length records, 'V' if you are writing
              a file of variable-length records.  This parameter is ignored if you are reading
              from the file.
   numRecords is the number of records to be read or written at a time.  This parameter can be
              greater than 1 only when reading or writing fixed-length records.
   recordNum  is the 1-based record number at which to begin reading or writing.  Specify 0
              when writing to append records to the file.
   file       is a pointer to a CMS file handle (FSCB).  It is updated by CMS when the file is
              opened.  Pass this as an argument to other file I/O functions.

Returns:
    0     Success.
   20     The fileid is invalid.
   28     The file was not found.  (Not an error if you intend to write a new file.)

Notes:
   1. After the file has been opened, the first call to either CMSfileRead or CMSfileWrite
      determines whether the file is open for reading or writing.  To switch between reading
      writing, the file must be closed, then re-opened.
   2. It is possible to overwrite a record within a file.  However, care must be taken that
      the record being written is the same length as the one it is replacing.  Failing to do
      this can result in corruption of the file and possibly the entire mini-disk.
   3. To overwrite an existing file with new records, call CMSfileErase to first erase the
      file, then open the file and begin writing from record 1.

int CMSfilePoint(CMSFILE * file, int recordNum, int readWrite)

Set the read or write pointer to a specific record in the file.
   file       is a pointer to a CMS file handle (FSCB).  It is updated by CMS when the file is
              opened.  Pass this as an argument to other file I/O functions.
   recordNum  is the 1-based record number at which to set the read or write pointer.
   readWrite  is CMS_POINTREAD to set the read pointer, CMS_POINTWRITE to set the write
              pointer.

Returns:
    0     Success.
    1     The file was not found.
    2     Parameter list error.

Notes:
   1. Pointing to an record number greater than the number of records in the file yields
      unpredictable results.

int CMSfileRead(CMSFILE * file, int recordNum, int *bytesRead)

Read one or more records from an open file.
   file       is the file handle (FSCB) of the open file.
   recordNum  is the record number at which to begin reading.  To read sequential records,
              specify 1 on the first call to CMSfileRead, and 0 on subsequent calls.
              Alternately, specify 1 as the 'recordNum' parameter in CMSfileOpen, and set
              'recordNum' to 0 on all CMSfileRead calls.  To use the record number currently
              set in the file handle (FSCB), specify -1.

Rename a file.
   oldFileid  is a pointer to the fileid of the file to be renamed.
   newFileid  is a pointer to the fileid of the new name for the file.

   Note that both oldFileid and newFileid are pointers to a CMS fileid, an 18 character field.
   The first 8 characters are the filename, the next 8 are the filetype, and the last 2 are
   the filemode.  Filename, filetype, and filemode must be in uppercase.  None of these fields
   are terminated with a NULL character.

Returns:

   24     Parameter list error (invalid character in fileid).
   28     The file was not found, or newFileid already exists.

Notes:
   1. This function calls the CMS RENAME command, which executes in the CMS transient area.
      Thus this function cannot be called from a C program executing in the transient area.

   fileid     is a pointer to the CMS fileid, an 18 character field.  It may be specified in
              any case, but will be translated to upper case.  The first 8 characters are the
              filename, the next 8 are the filetype, and the last 2 are the filemode.  The
              filename, filetype, and filemode may each be specified as *, in which case the

              sequential records, from the start of the file specify 'recordNum' of 1 on the
              call to CMSfileOpen, then specify -1 for 'recordNum' on calls to CMSfileWrite.
              Alternatively, specify 1 on the first call to CMSfileWrite, and 0 on subsequent
              calls.
   recordLen  is the length of the record to be written (in 'buffer').

Returns:
    0     Success.
    2     Invalid buffer address.
    4     First character of filemode is illegal.
    5     Second character of filemode is illegal.
    6     Record number too large.
    7     Attempt to skip over unwritten variable-length record.
    8     Buffer size not specified.
    9     File open for input.
   10     Maximum number of files reached.
   11     Record format not F or V.
   12     Attempt to write on read-only disk.
   13     Disk is full.
   14     Number of bytes written is not integrally divisible by the number of records to be
          written.
   15     Length of fixed-length recod not the same as previous record.
   16     Record format specified is not the same as that of the file.
   17     Variable-length record is greater than 65K bytes.
   18     Number of records to write is greater than 1 for a variable length file.
   19     Maximum number of data blocks per file (16060) has been reached.
   20     Invalid character detected in filename.
   21     Invalid character detected in filetype.
   22     Virtual storage capacity exceeded.
   25     Insufficent free storage available for file directory buffers.
   27     Attempting to write a variable-length record of different length from the record
          being replaced.

Notes:
   1. It is possible to overwrite a record within a file.  However, care must be taken that
      the record being written is the same length as the one it is replacing.  Failing to do
      this can result in corruption of the file and possibly the entire mini-disk.
   2. To overwrite an existing file with new records, call CMSfileErase to first erase the
      file, then open the file and begin writing from record 1.

void * CMSmemoryAlloc(int bytes, int type)

Allocate free memory.
  bytes      is the number of bytes to be allocated.
  type       is the type of memory: CMS_NUCLEUS for NUCLEUS memory, CMS_USER for USER memory.

Returns:
   the address of the allocated memory, or NULL if the memory could not be allocated.

Notes:
   1.  If you allocate NUCLEUS memory, your program must be generated with the SYSTEM option.
       Note that if such a program abnormally terminates, CMS does not release this memory.

/*************************************************************************************************
int CMSprintLine(char * line)

Write a line to the virtual printer.
   line   is a pointer to the line to be printeed.  The first character of the line must be a
          carriage control character (a blank skips to a new line).  The string must be NULL
          terminated.  The maximum length of the line is 133 characters for a virtual 1403
          printer (the default), 151 characters for a virtual 3211 printer; a line longer than
          this results in an error.

Returns:
    0     Success.
    1     Line too long.
    2     Channel 12 punch sensed (virtual 3211 only).
    3     Channel 9 punch sensed (virtual 3211 only).
    4     Intervention required.
    5     Unknown error.
  100     Printer not attached.

Notes:
   1.  Use the CP CLOSE command to close the virtual printer.  You can issue this via the
       CMScommand function.

int CMSstackLine(char * line, int order)

Place a line on the CMS console stack.
   line   is a pointer to the line to be stacked.  In VM/370 the line may be no longer than
          130 characters; on VM/SP or z/VM it may be no longer than 256 characters.  If the
          string pointed to by 'line' is greater than this, it is truncated without warning.
   order  is 0 if the line is to be stacked 'LIFO', anything else for 'FIFO'.  The definitions
          CMS_STACKLIFO and CMS_STACKFIFO may be used for this.

Returns:
   0
